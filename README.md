Overview
This project is a clone of ChatGPT, a conversational AI chatbot. It leverages the OpenAI API to allow users to interact with a virtual assistant through a chat interface built using JavaScript, specifically React.

Features
Interactive chat interface: Send messages and receive responses in real-time from ChatGPT.
Uses OpenAI API: Integrates seamlessly with the OpenAI API to provide natural language processing.
Automatic message scrolling: The chat window scrolls to the latest message automatically as new messages are sent.
Real-time updates: Manage state effectively with React to handle conversations.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

A GitHub account to clone the repository.
An OpenAI API key. You can obtain this by signing up on OpenAI and creating a new API key.
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatgpt-clone.git
cd chatgpt-clone
2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary npm packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set Up Your API Key
In your App.js or relevant file, replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key:

javascript
Copy code
const apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE";
4. Run the Application
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works
Chat Interface:

The user can type messages in the input box and send them by clicking the "Send" button.
Messages from the user and responses from ChatGPT are displayed in a chat window.
The chat window automatically scrolls to show the latest message.
API Integration:

The user’s input is sent to the OpenAI API endpoint.
The API processes the message and returns a response.
The response is then displayed in the chat window.
State Management with React:

The chat messages are managed using React’s useState and useEffect hooks.
Automatic scrolling to the latest message is handled with the useRef hook in React.
Key Technologies Used
React: For building the chat interface and handling state changes.
JavaScript: To interact with the OpenAI API and manage the DOM.
OpenAI API: To generate responses from the chatbot
